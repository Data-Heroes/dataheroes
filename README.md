DataHeroes is a Python library that solves some of todayâ€™s biggest machine learning challenges: reducing the time, effort and resources required to develop and maintain high-quality machine learning models.
</p>

DataHeroes uses a unique methodology called Coresets, originating in computational geometry, to reduce the size of the dataset to a small subset that maintains the statistical properties and corner cases of the full dataset, such that solving a problem on the Coreset will yield the same result as solving it on the full dataset (to learn more about Coresets, visit our [Introduction to Coresets](https://dataheroes.ai/introduction-to-coresets/) page).
