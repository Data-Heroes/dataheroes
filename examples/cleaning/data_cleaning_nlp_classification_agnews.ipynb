    "Following a data-centric approach, the quality of the machine learning (ML) model is highly dependent on the quality of the data used to train it. Unfortunately, despite curators best efforts, the provided data can still include errors or miss-classifications. It is a well-known issue that data scientists spend more than half their time cleaning the data. One challenge for using a dataset is that there is no \"go-to\" method of finding errors in the dataset, such as faulty labels or samples that do not fit the business use case."

    "Coresets refer to a sampling methodology originating in computational geometry used to approximate optimization problems. They are based on selecting a subset of the original dataset that maintains the entire dataset's statistical properties (including the corner cases). Training a model on the Coreset should give the same result as training it on the full dataset.\n",

    "When computing a Coreset, every instance in the dataset is assigned an importance value, which indicates how important it is to the final ML model. Samples that receive a high importance value in the Coreset computation require the attention of the data scientist as they usually indicate a labeling error or other data-related issues. Therefore, leveraging the Coresets, we can easily assign an importance score to each sample. Instances with high importance scores have a high probability of being mislabeled. Thus, we can sample instances of interest by looking at the top percentile of importance.\n",
